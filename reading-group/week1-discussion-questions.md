1. **Understanding Different Causal Queries:**  
   How do the causal queries (e.g., causal discovery, ATE/CATE estimation, counterfactual reasoning) outlined in **Causal AI** compare to the kinds of causal questions traditional econometric studies ask?

2. **Framing the Right Causal Question:**  
   Both texts emphasize the importance of correctly posing a causal question. What (if any) are the key differences in framing a causal question for a business application (e.g., optimizing churn rate) versus for an economic analysis (e.g., estimating price elasticity)?

3. **The Role of Assumptions:**  
   How does making explicit causal assumptions -- whether expressed via counterfactual notation or identification strategies -- support valid inference in both machine learning and economic contexts?

4. **Counterfactual Reasoning in Practice:**  
   **Causal AI** emphasizes using counterfactual reasoning (e.g., “what if the recommendation algorithm had been different?”). How does this approach help in attributing effects, and how does it compare to counterfactual approaches in policy evaluation or economic research?

5. **Randomization Versus Endogeneity:**  
   Discuss why randomization or approximations to randomization are so crucial in causal inference. How do both texts address the problems that arise from endogeneity when randomization is absent?

6. **Commodification of Inference:**  
   The idea of “commodifying inference” allows modern AI frameworks to abstract away statistical details. How might a similar approach or tool-based solution help streamline causal inference in economic research?

7. **Fairness and Bias:**  
   How does causal inference contribute to understanding and mitigating bias or unfair outcomes in both algorithmic decision-making (as in AI) and economic policy (e.g., discrimination in loan approvals)?

8. **Dealing with Confounding:**  
   What strategies do the documents propose for handling confounders? Compare the techniques from the **Causal AI** perspective (e.g., leveraging DAGs) with traditional methods in econometrics.

9. **Mathematical Formalization of Causality:**  
    The approach from **Causal AI** breaks the problem into “pose the question, write down the math, do the inference.” How does this structured process relate to the way economists formalize models (e.g., specifying demand functions or using difference-in-differences)?

10. **Causal Inference in Computer Vision Versus Economics:**  
    In the MNIST example, the authors integrate causal reasoning into image analysis. How does this differ from the traditional way that the MNIST data set is presented? What are the advantages of knowing the causal story that Yann LeCun explained about the dataset?

11. **Attribution and Credit Assignment:**  
    How do the methods for counterfactual reasoning and attribution in **Causal AI** compare with econometric techniques for isolating the impact of a specific factor (for example, in policy evaluation)?

12. **Integration of Domain Expertise:**  
    Both texts stress the need for contextual or institutional knowledge. How can domain expertise be integrated into both machine learning models and economic research designs to strengthen causal claims?

13. **Optimization and Endogenous Behavior:**  
    The **Causal Inference: A Mixtape** highlights that optimal human behavior can cancel out observable correlations. How does causal inference help disentangle such effects in both business applications and economic theory?

14. **Practical Experimentation:**  
    Discuss how the design and analysis of experiments differ when using the methods from **Causal AI** versus traditional randomized or quasi-experimental designs in the social sciences.

15. **Role of DAGs in Causal Analysis:**  
    How do directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) facilitate causal reasoning in both the the **Causal AI** framework and classical econometric identification strategies?

16. **Handling Observational Data:**  
    The challenge in answering causal questions in both books stem from the challenge of working with observational data. What are the similarities and differences in the approaches to causal inference when experiments are not possible?

17. **Algorithmic Automation Versus Human Expertise:**  
    The **Causal AI** book recommends automating parts of the inference process. What might be the benefits and pitfalls of relying on automated causal inference tools compared to theory-driven approaches in economic research?

18. **Extrapolation and Generalizability:**  
    The approach in **Causal AI** emphasizes models that generalize across different environments (e.g., churn across different user segments). How does this goal compare with economists’ interest in external validity and generalizing causal estimates beyond the sample data?
